Description: MatrixEpistasis exhaustively scans all pairwise genetic
    interactions for quantitative traits. MatrixEpistasis works on both discrete
    genotype and continuous imputed genotype data. MatrixEpistasis can adjust
    covariates for epistasis detection, such as gender, age, and population
    structure. The excellent time-efficiency of MatrixEpistasis is achieved by the
    following innovations: 1) it expresses the intensive computation in terms of
    large matrix inner products (notably, no matrix inverse), avoiding separately
    calculating each epistasis model; 2) out of all regression coefficients
    (including two additive terms, one interaction term and multiple covariate
    terms), MatrixEpistasis only calculates the test statistic for the interaction
    term, largely alleviating the computational complexity; 3) the resulting test
    statistics from MatrixEpistasis are comparable, so that MatrixEpistasis can
    calculate p-values only for those exceeding the required significance level,
    therefore discarding a large number of incomplete beta or gamma functions.
